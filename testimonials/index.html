  <p>"Riding bike in winter = there is a shirst wrapped around my head."</p>

  <p>"This is all on me, but I placed an order for the wrong size. I ordered a small instead of an extra small. I was wondering if there was any way you could change the order to an extra small. If not then that's okay. I'll still live with a small; it doesn't matter too much."</p>

  <p>"Dope dope dope."</p>

  <p>"Love the sweaters, will you sell them to a guy in Sweden? i.e. international sale."</p>

  <p>"You should donate these shirts to a prison."</p>

  <p>"Shirst is like the mongolian grill of clothing."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I love it so much, but it's funky and is heavy-ish denim so it adds a nice dynamic to whatever I'm wearing."</p>

  <p>"I've found that it looks best with olive chinos. I've also worn it with a bunch of denim, but I always feel really on point with my olive chinos with it."</p>

  <p>"I have a half-dozen of your sweaters, and wear them all the time. Light is my 'Dress Denim' and Inside Out Light is my work shirt."</p>

  <p>"Amazing shirts! My friend lent me one and I secretly do not ever want to give it back. I have worn it everyday for a week. I’m in love."</p>

  <p>"Great sweater, but lately it's been getting a bit dirty, what would be the best way to wash it?"</p>

  <p>"Most people were wearing tons of layers, but my reliable sweater handled the beating from the hike and the wind all on its own."</p>

  <p>"Hey How Do I Add To My Cart On Your Website??   Cause I Don't See A Option Where I Can"</p>

  <p>"I've received more compliments on my denim jacket than any clothing I've ever worn in my life."</p>

  <p>"This sweater is the fucking shit"</p>
  
  <p>"Wearing my new shirst. My arms finally know what my legs feel like."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure ill grab more denim once this fucking weather chills out."</p>

  <p>"I bought a denim sweater a couple of months ago and have worn it almost every day since. Its my favorite piece of clothing! I work in a fabrication shop and its the only thing that I want to wear to work that is spark-proof and comfortable!"</p>

  <p>"First, let me say that you guys make an excellent product. Unfortunately..."</p>
